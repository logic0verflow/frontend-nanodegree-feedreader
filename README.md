# Feed Reader Testing

In this project we are setting up a test suite to ensure that functionality in
the feed reader application works as intended. The application testing relies
on the Jasmine framework.


## Getting Started

Download a copy of the project contents by either downloading as a zip file
[here](https://github.com/logic0verflow/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/archive/master.zip)
or using the git command below in a PCs terminal with Git installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/logic0verflow/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
```

Once downloaded, open the **index.html** file in a modern web browser and
check the current test at the bottom of the page. All current test pass and
their implementations can be found in **/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js**
